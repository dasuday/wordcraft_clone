# WordCraft architecture

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-15 · **Change:** minor (RTL visual geometry audit; previously minor: shared RTL UI support and regression coverage; previously minor: `proof` is per language: English and Polish; previously major: first committed version; `plan/architecture.md` is local-only) · **Target:** Microsoft Word (Microsoft 365) for Mac 16.113.4

How WordCraft is built today (origin/main `40c5d51`). The longer design notes in
`plan/architecture.md` are gitignored and local to the original author's machine; this file is the
committed, current summary. Rules for working in the code are in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Layers

~85,600 lines of Rust, 15 crates, 3 apps and `xtask`. Layering is enforced by `cargo xtask layers`:
a crate may only depend on crates in lower layers, and nothing below L6 depends on egui, eframe,
winit or rfd.

| Layer | Crate | Lines | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | `geom` | 0.2k | Units (points, twips, EMU, inches, cm), rectangles, measurement parsing |
| L1 | `doc` | 10.0k | Document model: stories, paragraphs, runs, tables, sections, styles, numbering, fields, notes, comments, revisions, equations (OMML-shaped math tree, linear/LaTeX input); edit primitives; bidi |
| L1 | `fonts` | 2.3k | Font database (bundled OFL + system fonts), metrics, outlines, shaping with HarfRust, Word font substitution (`word.rs`: Carlito ↔ Calibri, Caladea ↔ Cambria, Liberation ↔ Arial/Times/Courier), OpenType MATH |

| apps | `wordcraft-cli` | 0.4k | `convert`, `text`, `inspect`, `run`, `commands`, `parity`, `mcp`, `zotero` |
| apps | `wordcraft-web` | 0.3k | Browser build (eframe web runner, WebGPU with WebGL2 fallback) |

## Data flow

1. **Open:** `engine::io` picks a reader by extension (`docx`, `docbin`, `formats`, JSON) and
   produces a `doc::Document`.
2. **Edit:** every user-visible action is a command id run through `Session::run` (ribbon,
   shortcuts, command search, CLI, control channel and MCP all dispatch by id). `Session::run`
   snapshots for undo (blocks are `Arc`-shared, so snapshots are cheap) and catches an escaped
   panic, restoring the document (never-crash standard).
3. **Layout:** `layout` turns the document into pages of positioned glyphs, boxes and images
   (display list), incrementally: an edit relayouts only what changed (1.4 ms on a 188-page
   document, measured 2026-10-06).
4. **Draw:** the UI paints pages through `render` (CPU raster, cached per page, pixel-aligned) on
   an egui/wgpu canvas; PDF export walks the same display list through `pdf`.
5. **Save:** `engine::io` picks a writer by extension.

## Testing and gates

- 821 `#[test]` functions and 10 property-test blocks: model, layout, DOCX round-trip and hostile
  input, `.doc`, formats, typing parity (`engine/src/tests_typing.rs`), bidi, i18n catalogs, UI
  interaction (egui_kittest), MCP acceptance; `hostile_params_never_panic` runs every command with
  junk params.
- `cargo xtask ci`: fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, asset attribution, layering, wasm build.
- `cargo xtask parity` regenerates [`parity-checklist.md`](parity-checklist.md); a test keeps the
  catalog percentage above a floor that only rises.
- GitHub Actions on PRs: packaging lint, and FreeBSD / Windows ARM64 when build files change;
  release builds on pushes to `release`.

## Interface reading direction

`ui-egui::rtl` centralizes interface direction. Wrap panel, window and popup bodies with
`rtl::root`, then use `rtl::column` for nested columns; egui's native `vertical` resets alignment.
Horizontal rows inherit the parent. `rtl::columns` preserves reading order where native
columns reset it. `rtl::singleline` aligns plain interface text and search hints without
reordering stored text; numeric/code editors retain their own rules. `rtl::form_field`
places a two-column form label before its value in reading order.
Use the shared combo, checkbox/radio and menu wrappers;
LTR delegates to the original egui operation. Custom-painted controls place their icon at the
reading start and their arrow at the opposite edge. New catalogs declare their reading direction in `LangInfo::rtl`; changing a display name
does not change layout.

Mirroring changes horizontal anchors, not caption line count or vertical geometry. Large ribbon
menu arrows stay beside the final caption line. RTL checkbox/radio wrappers measure their text
plus marker instead of reserving the full available row, preserving auto-sized dialog widths.
Template tiles reserve the larger of thumbnail and caption width and use natural row height.
The `visual_audit_*` tests compare actual text/icon geometry with identical English labels in
both directions; icon recording is opt-in and compiled only for tests.

Grids keep semantic columns in an LTR island aligned at the reading edge (egui cannot lay out a
Grid under an RTL parent). Data grids, equations and document geometry must not be blindly
reversed. Document paragraph direction controls its ruler and layout independently of UI direction.
Grid width caches exclude compressed window sizing passes; those provisional measurements
otherwise make subsequent fields overflow and inflate the auto-sized window.

`ui_bidi` arranges display labels with UAX #9 while egui shapes logical script stretches.
Catalogs retain logical translations (`tr`/preview contexts); formatting resolves templates before
arranging display text. Use `logical_fmt` for generated document values. Do not feed display-order
strings into document layout, persisted values or editable text. egui's editable fields and line
wrapping still need upstream bidi support; this is not a replacement document text engine.

Ribbon groups cache their actual mirrored intrinsic width and execute their content once;
the group column must use the same reading edge as its content, or minimum-width expansion
adds blank space. Group dividers use the trailing cursor edge in each direction.

The ribbon uses egui `ScrollArea` for clipping, scrolling and bounds. A measured finite
row width anchors RTL groups; vertical wheel input follows reading order. Horizontal
touchpad input keeps its physical direction. Do not implement a second scroll engine.

Local screenshots can be generated with `WORDCRAFT_RTL_AUDIT_DIR` and the
`tests_rtl::local_direction_screenshots` test. The synthetic catalog is compiled only for tests.

## Revision history

|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-15 | minor | Integrate main fd0bb2fb: preserve recovery, tab overflow, contextual template translations, Korean fonts, mixed Paragraph fields, new Tabs/Table Style forms and independently scrolling Print settings; RTL helpers cover the changed forms, with logical contextual-text and mixed-choice click regressions |
| 2026-10-15 | minor | Visual RTL audit: large-menu arrows stay beside the final caption line; choice controls and template tiles retain intrinsic size; custom chrome and recent-file icons follow the reading edge. Geometry and interaction regressions cover identical English labels in both directions |
| 2026-10-13 | minor | Shared RTL UI infrastructure and regression coverage: logical chart/preview text, reachable chart data, grid choice controls and preserved native LTR paths; catalogs, native frame and full bidi editing remain separate |
| 2026-10-10 | minor | `proof`: proofing languages (English, Polish), affix engine, Polish patterns; layout and engine route each run by its language |
| 2026-10-10 | major | First committed architecture doc, from the crates' sources and `AGENTS.md` |
